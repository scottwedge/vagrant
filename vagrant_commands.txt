# Trouble initializing system with "vagrant init" then "vagrant up" 
# Solved by: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23874260/error-when-trying-vagrant-up/45227911

# So to correctly initialize system must include image name
vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# Following basic instructions at:
https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vagrant/getting-started

# Vagrant help
vagrant help

# Found other vagrant images at: app.vagrantup.com/boxes/

# Trouble downloading generic/ubunto2010 image - maybe ran out of space since got a popup warning
that only 400 MB space was free?

# To delete image to make room
vagrant box help
vagrant box remove -h
vagrant box delete -h

# found similarly named image in Downloads/64bit/ 

# Then install virt-manager when warned that still had to manually delete the image
but it does not connect to anything
